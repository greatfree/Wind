GreatFree is a generic programming paradigm for the Internet-oriented computing environment. Because of the complexity of the particular circumstance, three technologies, including the distributed primitives (DP), the asynchronous messaging on the thread level (AMTL) and the steady patterns for rich application programming interfaces (SPRA), are proposed to achieve the general-purpose goal. The DP is made with the primitive distributed application programming interfaces (PDA) as well as the corresponding primitive distributed code-level design patterns (PDP). When programming with GreatFree, any distributed components and systems are originated from the DP. The AMTL provides developers with the asynchronous message-passing threading to implement high-quality distributed concurrent algorithms. SPRA unveils that the code of heterogeneous distributed systems is constructed with the homogeneous code-level design patterns. The phenomenon not only speeds up the development of distributed systems but also establishes the basis of the first generic distributed programming language for the Internet-oriented computing environment upon GreatFree.

The DP answers the question of the most fundamental components for distributed programming. As one of the foundations of GreatFree, the DP is identical to a proper abstraction of distributed techniques for distributed systems development. The abstraction shapes GreatFree to become a full coverage and rapid distributed development technique. The DP consists of two portions of programming components, i.e., the PDA and the PDP. The PDA supports a couple of rudimentary distributed functions and the PDP provides the stable structures to assemble the PDA into stable code.

The PDA represents the mandatory distributed computing resources and mechanisms to construct any distributed systems. If some of the PDA are invisible, it affects any programming techniques, including GreatFree, to adapt to various cases. On the other hand, if the ones encapsulated by the PDA are exposed, it raises the programming effort obviously. The PDA contains two categories of APIs, i.e., the distributed modeling and the distributed dispatching. The distributed modeling specifies the APIs that transform a standalone computing device to the interactive one, i.e., a physical single distributed node, in a distributed computing environment. The distributed dispatching is the scaling-up concurrent APIs that leverage computing resources from the distributed node efficiently and effectively. In other words, the distributed modeling supplies distributed computing resources and the distributed dispatching is the mechanism to exploit those resources.

Programming with the PDA only, it is necessary and sufficient to construct the simplest one, the two-node lightweight messaging client/server (TNCS) distributed system. More important, the self-contained derivation is the most distinguished character of the DP. It is convenient to program with the DP further only to create various advanced distributed APIs (ADA), distributed frameworks and distributed systems. Usually, two categories of ADAs, i.e., the distributed clustering and the distributed caching, are required to construct complicated systems. The distributed clustering performs scaling-out concurrency to enlarge the scale of distributed systems. In contrast, the distributed caching retains high volume data and keeps high performance to guarantee high scalability. The DP is necessary and sufficient for the rich derivation of those ADAs to accommodate with the complexity of distributed computing environments, especially the Internet-oriented one. In brief, the DP is critical for GreatFree to be a generic distributed programming technique in terms of the primitive distributed computing resources as well as the fundamental distributed computing mechanisms.

The AMTL is a distributed threading technique based on the asynchronous message-passing [] methodology. Different from any other message-passing concurrent programming paradigms [], the threads of the AMTL are managed and visible to developers. Because of the complexity of the Internet-oriented computing environment, it is impossible to predefine an omni-potent concurrency instrument to adapt to numerous diverse cases. It is required to allow developers to implement a specific algorithm to create, monitor, reuse and collect threads. Thus, the feature of visible threading is necessary for a generic distributed programming paradigm. In addition, the AMTL threads are different from the ones of memory-sharing in traditional programming languages []. Instead, the AMTL threads are transformed to the message-passing and managed ones such that they are easy to be programmed and adaptive to sophisticated distributed computing environments. Using the AMTL, developers are able to handle any number of remote threads residing on infinite distributed nodes conveniently to process intricate distributed tasks. As a novel distributed concurrency technique, the AMTL is another crucial foundation of GreatFree to become a generic distributed programming paradigm.

The SPRA is a phenomenon existing natively in code rather than a contrived technique. In accordance with the large amount of distributed programming experiences in various environments, it discovers that the code of heterogeneous distributed systems follows the homogeneous code-level design patterns, i.e., the PDP. Although it is necessary to derive diverse ADAs to simplify complicated distributed programming cases, the types of code-level design patterns do not increase with the new proposed APIs. Only the PDP is sufficient to adapt to any scenarios since the patterns for ADA are the straightforward aggregations of the PDP and no particular ones need to be invented for ADA. Thus, when programming with ADA, the same code structures are reusable for distinct distributed systems. The phenomenon reveals the truth that the structures of distributed code are independent of the natures of distributed systems even though there are a variety of mutations in the Internet-oriented computing environment. The discovery definitely speeds up distributed systems development. Moreover, it is feasible to generate distributed code upon domain-specific descriptions automatically following the patterns. In this way, it is practical to propose a new high-level programming language that encapsulates to replace the current solution of GreatFree. The same as GreatFree, the language is generic for the Internet-oriented computing environment as well. In short, the SPRA is the third technical foundation as it discloses the code structure principle for distributed programming.

It is different for application developers and system developers to program with GreatFree. Application developers always keep on modeling upper level applications only on one particular distributed framework, which is implemented with the DP as well as the ADA, without worrying about any distributed APIs and patterns of GreatFree. In contrast, system developers aim to implement new ADAs and new distributed frameworks such that it is required for them to follow the limited number of patterns of GreatFree to program with the PDA or existing ADA.

Compared with any other distributed programming paradigms [], GreatFree is distinct in the three aspects, i.e., the DP, the AMTL and the SPRA. In brief, GreatFree proposes appropriate programming components that conceal unnecessary low-level programming components as well as expose mandatory ones to speed up distributed systems development. More important, besides keeping low implementation efforts, the programming components of GreatFree are unique since they still allow developers to apply for distributed knowledge sufficiently to adapt to all kinds of distributed issues without the tradeoff of losing the control of indispensable distributed computing resources.

The current version of GreatFree is a distributed programming environment based on the three foundations rather than a new programming language. Although it is imperfect for that, the current solution has already become a novel distributed programming paradigm to raise the efficiency and the adaptability of any distributed systems development. It proves that GreatFree is an attainable technology to underpin the first generic distributed programming language for the Internet-oriented computing environment.
