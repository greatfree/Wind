GreatFree is a generic and self-contained distributed programming paradigm for the Internet-oriented computing environment. For the complexity of the particular circumstance, three technologies, i.e., the distributed primitives (DP), the asynchronous messaging on the thread level (AMTL) and the steady patterns for rich application programming interfaces (SPRA), are proposed to ensure the achievement of the goal. The DP is made up with the distributed primitive application programming interfaces as well as the corresponding distributed primitive code-level design patterns. Any distributed systems are originated from those primitives. To support sufficient flexibility to adapt to various distributed contexts, the AMTL provides developers with the message-passing based threading technique to design high-quality distributed concurrent algorithms. The SPRA unveils that the code of heterogenous distributed systems is constructed with homogeneous code-level design patterns. The phenomenon not only speeds up distributed systems development but also establishes the basis of the first generic and self-contained distributed programming language for the Internet-oriented computing environment upon GreatFree.


The DP answers the question of the fundamental components for distributed programming. As one of the foundations of GreatFree, the DP is identical to a proper abstraction for distributed techniques for distributed systems development. Based on the abstraction, it is feasible for GreatFree to be generic for coverage as well as rapid for development. The DP consists of two portions of programming components, i.e., the DPA and the DPP. The DPA supports a couple of rudimentary distributed functions and the DPP guides the way to assemble the DPA into stable code structures.

To be generic, the DPA represents the mandatory distributed computing resources and mechanisms to construct any distributed systems. If some of the DPA are invisible, it affects GreatFree to adapt to various cases. On the other hand, if the ones encapsulated by the DPA are exposed, it raises the programming effort. The DPA contains two categories of APIs, i.e., the distributed modeling and the distributed dispatching. The distributed modeling specifies the APIs that transform a standalone computing device to the interactive one, i.e., a physical single distributed node, in a distributed computing environment. The distributed dispatching is the scaling-up concurrent APIs that leverage computing resources from a physically single distributed node efficiently and effectively. In other words, the distributed modeling supplies distributed computing resources and the distributed dispatching is the mechanism to exploit those resources. Both of them are necessary and sufficient to construct the simplest distributed system, the two-node lightweight messaging client/server (TNCS) one.

More important, the self-contained derivation is the most important character of the DP. It is convenient to program with the DP further only to create various distributed advanced APIs (DAA), distributed frameworks and distributed systems. Two categories of DAAs are required to extend the DP, including the distributed clustering and the distributed caching. The distributed clustering is the APIs to perform scaling-out concurrency to enlarge the scale of distributed systems. The distributed caching is the ones to retain high volume data and keep high performance for a large-scale distributed system. The DP is sufficient for the derivation although there are rich implementations for those DAAs because of the complexity of distributed computing environments, especially the Internet-oriented one. In brief, the DP is critical for GreatFree to be a generic and self-contained distributed programming technique in terms of the primitive distributed computing resources as well as the fundamental distributed computing mechanisms.

The AMTL is a distributed threading technique based on the message-passing method to implement distributed concurrent algorithms. Different from any other message-passing concurrent programming paradigms, the ATML threads are visible and managed. Because of the complexity of the Internet-oriented computing environment, it is impossible to predefine an omni-potent concurrency mechanism to adapt to numerous diverse cases. It is required to allow developers to design a specific algorithm to create, monitor, reuse and collect threads. Thus, the feature of thread-visible is necessary for a generic programming paradigm. In addition, the threads of the AMTL is different from the memory-sharing and native ones in traditional programming languages. Instead, the AMTL threads are transformed to the message-passing and managed ones such that they are easy to be programmed and more adaptive to sophisticated distributed computing environments. Using the AMTL, developers are able to handle any number of remote threads residing on infinite distributed nodes conveniently to process intricate distributed tasks. As a novel distributed concurrency technique, the AMTL is another crucial foundation of GreatFree to become a generic distributed programming paradigm.

The SPRA is a phenomenon existed natively in code rather than a contrived technique. In accordance with the large amount of distributed programming experiences in various environments, it discovers that heterogeneous distributed systems are constructed with homogeneous code-level design patterns. Although it is necessary to propose diverse DAAs to simplify complicated distributed programming cases, the types of code-level design patterns do not update with the new proposed APIs. Only the DPP is sufficient to adapt to any scenarios since the patterns for DAA are the straightforward aggregations of the DPP and no particular ones are invented for DAA. Thus, when programming with DAA, the same code structures are reused for distinct distributed systems. The phenomenon reveals the truth that the structures of distributed code are independent of the natures of distributed systems even though there are a variety of mutations in the Internet-oriented computing environment. The discovery definitely speeds up distributed systems development. Moreover, it is feasible to generate distributed code upon developers’ descriptions automatically following the patterns. In this way, it is practical to propose a new high-level programming language that encapsulates the current solution of GreatFree. The same as GreatFree, the language is generic and self-contained for the Internet-oriented computing environment as well. The SPRA is the third technical foundation as it discloses the code structure principle for distributed programming.

It is different for application developers and system developers to program with GreatFree. Application developers always work with upper level application modeling only on one particular distributed framework, which is implemented with the DP as well as the DAA, without worrying about any distributed APIs and patterns of GreatFree. In contrast, it is required for system developers to follow the limited number of patterns of GreatFree to program with the DP or the DAA to create new DAAs or new distributed frameworks. In other words, for system developers, the upper level application modeling is equivalent to applying for distributed knowledge for one particular domain. Therefore, they have to employ the design patterns and the relevant APIs of GreatFree. It is fortunate that the procedure becomes straightforward with the support of the SPRA.

The current version of GreatFree is still a distributed programming environment based on the DP, the AMTL and the SPRA rather than a new programming language. Since established on the JDK 1.8, GreatFree is programmed with in the same way as JSE from developers’ point of view. Although it is not perfect for that, the current solution has already become a novel distributed programming paradigm to raise the efficiency and the adaptability of any distributed systems development. It also indicates that GreatFree is an attainable technology to create the first generic and self-contained distributed programming language for the Internet-oriented computing environment.
